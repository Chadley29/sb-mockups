          Please be advised that there is currently a
          <b>Wallet ID payment scam targeting Standard Bank customers</b>. The
          fraudsters orchestrate the scam using the following methods:
        </p>
        <div class="scam-methods">
          <ul>
            <li>
              Send an e-mail or SMS messaging embedded with phishing/smishing
              links
            </li>
            <li>
              Telephonically contact unsuspecting victims with an intent to get
              them to compromise their card credentials and OTP required to
              enable cash out using the smart device /wallet ID payment
              platforms
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="how-the-scam-works">
          <p>
            <b>How the scam works:</b>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Customer will receive a link via e-mail or SMS</li>
            <li>The link may entice them with bargain deals</li>
            <li>
              Upon clicking the link, the customer may be requested to capture
              or update their card details
            </li>
            <li>
              The request is often accompanied by the threat that if the card
              details are not captured or updated, the customerâ€™s card/account
              will be blocked
            </li>
            <li>
              If the customer receives a telephone call, the fraudster will ask
              the customer for their card details to capture the order on their
              behalf or to update their banking details
            </li>
            <li>
              Based on the above, the fraudsters then registers the customer for
              a wallet ID
            </li>
            <li>
              An OTP is generated to provision the card and the customer either
              captures the OTP or shares it with the caller
            </li>
