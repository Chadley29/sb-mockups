          We sent out communications about clients abroad on January 27, 2023.
          In the communication, we stated that customers calling from overseas
          should be sent either to their relationship banker, if they have one,
          or to the PSE team, if they do not. (To view the communication,
          <a href="#">click here.</a>)

            If you receive a call from a customer who is currently overseas and
            needs assistance on the abovementioned demands, they will fall into
            one of these two categories:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A customer is overseas and
